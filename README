This project was my last project for the second semester of the MSCS_Ready Program at clemson. 
I do not take credit for this being an original idea, but the code provided in the .cpp and .h files is of my own.

To use properly, start but entering in a file of your choice when promted with number 3.
Then you can choose to edit, list, or exit from the menu like you would if you were a store manager.
